## 📫 • General:

 - Plugin Introduction: 

   > This plugin implements a custom Hardcore mode in pocketmine, of course this plugin will not implement hardcore vanilla in pocketmine, but a similar way in which you can customize.
 
 - Plugin Features:

   > This plugin is subdivided into features by category! All categories:
   > **[General](https://github.com/Henry12960/Hardcore/new/main?readme=1#--features)**, 
   > **[Game Over](https://github.com/Henry12960/Hardcore/new/main?readme=1#--features)**,
   > **[On Death](https://github.com/Henry12960/Hardcore/new/main?readme=1#--features)**,
   > **[Tp Form](https://github.com/Henry12960/Hardcore/new/main?readme=1#--features)**.

 - Suggestions:

   > As a hardcore creator I have some suggestions for the plugin configuration, avoid using flags like `pvp` wrong, this configuration can end up harming the gameplay of your world!

   > Avoid putting keep inventory worlds with the `same name` as the Hardcore world, this may cause an internal conflict due to dying in the Hardcore world your inventory will be cleared immediately.
